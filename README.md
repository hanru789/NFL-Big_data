# I. Introduction

Strategy is a pivotal component of every NFL game. NFL strategy drills blend tactical analysis with physical execution to prepare teams effectively. The process typically begins with meetings and film studies to dissect opponents' playing patterns. These are followed by non-contact walkthroughs to clarify each player’s roles and responsibilities. On-field training includes scenario-specific drills, such as red-zone or two-minute drills, alongside position-specific exercises. Scout teams replicate opposing formations, enabling the main team to adapt their strategies. Post-practice activities, including game simulations and tape reviews, identify and address mistakes, and refine strategies for real-game scenarios.

Strategic decisions during NFL games are a collaborative effort between coaches and key players. The head coach holds primary authority over overall strategy, including critical decisions such as timeout usage, fourth-down plays, and challenges to referee decisions. Offensive and defensive coordinators devise specific tactics for their respective units, with quarterbacks leading offensive adjustments through audibles and formation changes based on defensive observations. On defence, the middle linebacker or designated defensive captain orchestrates formations and in-game adjustments. Additionally, the special teams coordinator oversees tactics for kicking situations, such as punts and field goals. Effective strategy implementation relies on seamless collaboration between coaches and players, facilitated by headset communication.

Training for optimal positioning strategies in the NFL combines in-depth analysis, simulations, and data-driven evaluations. The process begins with studying game footage to identify opponents’ tendencies and the team’s strengths and weaknesses. Based on these insights, coaches craft playbooks tailored to specific game scenarios. Training sessions involve simulations using scout teams that mimic opponents’ strategies, testing the effectiveness of tactics. Situational drills, such as red-zone or two-minute scenarios, prepare players for critical moments. Advanced technology and data analytics evaluate opponents' tendencies and support statistically-informed decision-making. The process concludes with the evaluation and refinement of strategies based on feedback and training outcomes, ensuring readiness for in-game application.

Despite its rigour, this training process is time-intensive, limiting the number of strategy simulations possible during preparation. This challenge inspired the development of the research presented in this paper.

# II. Idea


This paper proposes the development of an artificial intelligence (AI) model structured as an evaluation matrix capable of simulating the success or failure of pre-snap formations in football games. The model analyzes various variables, including player positions, opposing team formations, and potential offensive or defensive patterns post-snap. Utilizing deep learning techniques, the system processes historical data and contextual parameters to predict the pattern of successful formations accurately. The ultimate objective is to provide a tool that assists coaches in real-time tactical decision-making and aids players in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the implemented position. This approach aims to enhance the efficiency of strategy evaluation in dynamic competitive scenarios.


# III. Data Preprocessing
![Feature and Label figure](https://github.com/hanru789/NFL-POSITIONING-TRAINING-ASISTANCE/raw/main/Image/NFL%202025.png)

### Third Down Scenarios:
Among the extensive dataset, the analysis focuses on third-down plays, as they represent critical moments where both offence and defence typically perform at their peak. Pre-snap data from third-down plays is utilized to train the convolutional neural network (CNN) model.
### Pre-snap Data:
From the selected third-down scenarios, only pre-snap data is considered for analysis.
### Frame Normalization:
Only the last frames are used.
### Feature Extraction:
Key features include player positions (encoded as integer coordinates x, y then transformed using one-hot encoding), play direction, and yards to gain.
### Label Extraction:
Labels are assigned a value of 1 for plays that successfully achieve a first down and gain at least 10 yards from the line of scrimmage.
### Data Splitting:
The dataset is divided into 80% training data (including 20% validation data) and 20% test data.

# IV. CNN-Model

![Model accuracy](https://github.com/hanru789/NFL-POSITIONING-TRAINING-ASISTANCE/raw/main/Image/accuracy.png)

This code performs a grid search to optimize several hyperparameters of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, such as the number of filters, kernel size, pool size, dropout rate, L2 regularization, batch size, and learning rate. Each hyperparameter combination is used to build and train a CNN model with several convolutional, pooling, dropout, and dense layers with regularization to prevent overfitting. The model is trained on the training data for 45 epochs and evaluated on the test data to measure accuracy and loss. The training results are saved as both the model and history files (such as accuracy and loss per epoch). Subsequently, a classification report is generated to assess the model's performance in classifying the data. The code also includes error handling to address issues that may arise during the training process.

# * V. Implementation Using [Streamlit](https://nfl-big-data.streamlit.app/)

The resulting CNN model is implemented in a formation simulation application built using Streamlit. This application processes positional data for offensive and defensive players and predicts the probability of success of specific formations. Although the model’s accuracy may appear modest in nominal terms, this is intentional. The predictions focus exclusively on players positioning, excluding other influencing factors. This design ensures the simulation application emphasizes the strategic advantages of specific formations, providing a valuable tool for strategy evaluation and optimization.

# VI. Discussion

This paper introduces a novel approach for evaluating NFL strategies through AI-driven simulation and analysis, emphasizing third-down scenarios and pre-snap data. By employing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, the research aims to predict the success of specific formations, providing coaches and players with real-time insights for tactical decision-making. The model primarily focuses on player positioning and formation evaluation, excluding other factors to enhance its applicability in strategy optimization.
